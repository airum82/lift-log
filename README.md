# lift-log

## Description:

The main purpose of this app is to track workouts with detailed metrics. It was made using MongoDb, Express, Vue and firebase. I used this tech stack to practice MongoDb and Vue. I am currently not using Vuex as it is not necessary for the current project but I may implement it later if state becomes difficult to manage. I am currently still working on the MVP.
